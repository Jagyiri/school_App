...Steps to setup School Management software....

DATBASE SETUP

1. Create a folder named 'school' in the wwww directory of your webserver.

2. Clone all files down from git into this folder.
   *Git username: Jagyiri

3. Make sure your phpmyadmin has Username: 'root' and Password= '' (empty paswword field)
   or else you would have to modify all db.php files in the school folder
   with your phpmyadmin credentials. Which might be hectic.

4. Create a database in phpmyadmin with name 'jc_db'.

5. Click on the import tab at the top menu. Browse for the database_files/jc(1).sql
   directory in the shop folder.
   
6. Click go to start the import process. Please use the default import options
   don't make any addition selections before import.

GRAPHICS SETUP
1. Input 'localhost/school/menu.php' into your browser.
2. Upon loading Zoom out your browser from the default 100% to 67-70%. This 
   improvision is due to poor graphics design on my part.
3. Now feel free to mess around!!
